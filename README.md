```
I have created this voice assistant under the guidance of ACM ,IIT Roorkee.
This assistant can perform various tasks like google search, wikipedia search, open any website, tell date and time, music play, write email ,chat with the user or can perofrm any other chatting task the user says.
I have used OpenAI API to perform the chatting tasks and pyAudio library to take the user voice input.
Other than this, for the chatting facility, we have to use amazon code whisper toolkit.
techStack: python 3.12, pycharm IDE
